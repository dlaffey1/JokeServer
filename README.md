# How to run
Under the Src folder, run main.java. This will run the joke server and initially run 5 threads proving the multithreaded functionality by printing 5 random jokes. Then type JOKE in the terminal and press enter for another joke or type and enter "END" to shut down the server.
The tests are located in the Tests folder(we did not manage to get these working) under src and the Client, ServerHost, and ReadCSV file are located under the Project_files folder under src.
